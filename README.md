# moodycats

It looks like there are a few functions (helper text in the code) that I don't see in the assignment instructions, so I might need clarification on those if necessary?

It also looks like it wants me to style the cat images dynamically with mood changes, but as I am loading those images dynamically from the robohash website provided, it is going to be a little tricky.
